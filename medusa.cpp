** Description:     Medusa class is derived from Character. Medusa
**                  has a special offensive ability that allows her
**                  to immediately defeat her opponents upon rolling
**                  an attack dice of 12. Medusa has attack dice of
**                  2d6 and defense dice of 1d6. Vampire's charm
**                  trumps Medusa's glare.
